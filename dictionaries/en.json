In fact it is not mandatory that Trivia winners have to get a prize and almost everyone is ok with that as their main objective is to have fun and learn at the same time. Trivia questions and answers can be adapted to any audience and can be used in schools and universities to assist in language skills development and to test knowledge and skills levels.",
